TL;DR Summary
-------------

My public-facing projects (open source ones/etc) cannot support NetBSD[https://www.netbsd.org/] yet, despite being capable of being built and tested on many Linux distributions, FreeBSD, and often also Microsoft Windows, due to the lack of version 5 of DocBook/XML in pkgsrc[http://www.pkgsrc.org/] .

Introduction
------------

This is a sequel to a previous feature[https://github.com/shlomif/what-i-learned-from-porting-to-freebsd] about what I learned from porting my projects to build and pass tests FreeBSD and which received some coverage on reddit and hackernews. In a hackernews comment, someone suggested that "`now you should try openbsd or netbsd, as they are even less tolerant of linux-isms`". As this comment seemed to be of merit, I decided to try porting them to NetBSD which I heard was easier to install at the time than OpenBSD (which may no longer be true).

Note that I don't expect this sequel to be as popular as the original, and I'm not writing it for achieving worldwide fame and fortune, just as an update on my progress.

What worked
-----------

NetBSD was fairly easy to install for me on a VirtualBox VM, as easy as FreeBSD and much easier than the https://shlomif-tech.livejournal.com/64318.html[user-hostile installer of Arch linux] (which to its defence was replaced by an easy to use graphical installer in https://manjaro.org/[Manjaro] and possibly some other Arch derivatives). Setting up pkgsrc was fairly straightforward as well (but could have been made somewhat easier by adding some preinstalled scripts). NetBSD seemed fast enough or even very fast, and it was easy to build many of my projects dependencies.

Note that I used a graphical web browser on the host mageia linux system, to look up some commands and idioms out of convenience, but everything may be documented inside the guest VM's bundled documentation - I didn't check.
